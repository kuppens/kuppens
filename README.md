### Hey, whats up?  ðŸ«¡

I'm an AI enthusiast with a strong passion for leveraging technology to drive improvement, currently serving in the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General (CGU).

While I'm particularly interested in projects that intersect with Governmental Audit, my enthusiasm for problem-solving through AI is not confined to the public sector. I'm always looking for ways to apply my skills to new and diverse projects, irrespective of the industry.
